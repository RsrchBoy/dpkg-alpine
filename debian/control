Description: Simple text editor from Alpine, a text-based email client
 "pico" is a simple but powerful text editor.  It was originally the pine composer,
 the editor used by the pine email client for writing email messages.
 .
 It has gained popularity since its initial use in that context and is now used
 as a stand-alone editor by many users.
 .
 It is similar to but less powerful than GNU Nano, an editor created with the pico interface
 when the pico license was non-free.
