This is the Debian GNU/Linux package for the alpine mail and news
reader.

Earlier versions of alpine came directly from the University of
Washington. Since development there has stopped, this package uses
the re-alpine project <http://sourceforge.net/projects/re-alpine>'s
current tarball.

Some files have been removed to comply with the Debian Free Software
Guidelines. See Debian bug #641479 <http://bugs.debian.org/641479>
for more history. Particular files that were removed are:

* pico/msmem.c. Reason: File has, at best, ambiguous permission to distribute.

A lot of "ldap" binaries with no obvious source code within the
tarball, and that are not needed to do a build. Here is a list of them:

* ldap/binaries/debug/ldap32.lib
* ldap/binaries/debug/libldap.dll
* ldap/binaries/debug/libldap.lib
* ldap/binaries/debug/ltest32.exe
* ldap/binaries/debug/ltest.exe
* ldap/binaries/release/ldap32.dll
* ldap/binaries/release/ldap32.lib
* ldap/binaries/release/libldap.dll
* ldap/binaries/release/libldap.lib
