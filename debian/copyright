This is the Debian GNU/Linux package for the alpine mail and news
reader.

Earlier versions of alpine came directly from the University of
Washington. Since development there has stopped, this package uses
the alpine tarball created by Eduardo Chappa, who has indicated in
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.mail.alpine.info/4862 that he
licenses the tarball under Apache License 2.0. It also contains work
created by members of the  re-alpine project
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/re-alpine> who have previously
released that work as Apache License 2.0.

Some files have been removed to comply with the Debian Free Software
Guidelines. See Debian bug #641479 <http://bugs.debian.org/641479>
for more history. Particular files that were removed are:

A lot of "ldap" binaries with no obvious source code within the
tarball, and that are not needed to do a build. Here is a list of them:

* alpine/ldap32.dll
* ldap/binaries/debug/ldap32.lib
* ldap/binaries/debug/libldap.dll
* ldap/binaries/debug/libldap.lib
* ldap/binaries/debug/ltest32.exe
* ldap/binaries/debug/ltest.exe
* ldap/binaries/release/ldap32.dll
* ldap/binaries/release/ldap32.lib
* ldap/binaries/release/libldap.dll
* ldap/binaries/release/libldap.lib
